Most shell users at some point of time would feel the need to have a multi-threaded download manager something more than just `wget`. I was no different. While I was searching for one, I learnt that `wget` could not do it natively, but could be hacked into doing it – see this [Stack Overflow Answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7645245/482176).

wget for multi threaded downloads

```
wget -r -np -N <url> &
wget -r -np -N <url> &
wget -r -np -N <url> &
wget -r -np -N <url> &
...
```

Even though `wget` cannot execute a multi threaded download, it can continue a broken download if used with the `-c` flag.

Resuming a broken download using `wget`.

```
wget -c <url>
```

However, I did not like it and continued to look for more. I came across a script called `aget` - http://www.enderunix.org/aget/. I soon realized that `aget` did not handle https URLs and I immediately ditched it. Finally I stumbled upon a tool called `axel` – http://freecode.com/projects/axel. This is an easy to use multi threaded downloader for the shell. `axel` is included in the repositories of most major distribution now, and can be installed easily using the default package manager. For example -

```
sudo apt-get install axel
```

Unlike `wget`, the command line options for using axel are very simple -

```
axel -n 10 <uri>
```

This downloads the file specified by the `<uri>` using 10 concurrent connections. A primer on using axel can be found in this [article from Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/speed-your-downloads-axel).

The same Stack Overflow answer lists several alternatives. One of the alternatives that looked impressive was `aria2c` - http://aria2.sourceforge.net/. `aria2c` also seems to have the ability to handle bit-torrents and magnet URLs.

I wish `apt` and `yum` could download packages concurrently as well.
